JBS_INS_16_STATEMENT1="Welcome to Joomla Bible Study.  This component is designed to help your church communicate the gospel and teachings in the Word of God. Joomla Bible Study allows you to enter detailed information about the studies given and links to multimedia content you have uploaded to your server. You can also display full text or notes. All this is searchable in many different ways and you have a lot of control over how much information is displayed on the front end."
JBS_INS_16_STATEMENT2="It is very important that you do a couple of things when you first install the component."
JBS_INS_16_STATEMENT3="1. Go to Components &brvbar; Joomla Bible Study. There should be a sample study there. Now click on the Administration tab. There you will find a few settings you can use. Notice the Permissions/Filters tab at the top too. Next click on Templates. There should be a default template listed. This is where the display settings are kept. Take some time to look through the drop downs and see how they affect the various views you set up. You can create new templates if you like. When you create menu items linking to the various view of the component you will choose which template should be accessed. If you are going to only use the default template then just choose that one (the component will default to this template if it can&#39;t find one)"
JBS_INS_16_STATEMENT4="2. Go back to Components | Bible Study. Click on the Servers and add your server. Remember, you are building a url that someone could paste into their browser &ndash; this isn&#39;t to your web root, but your web site address. Be sure to follow the instructions of how to put in that entry. Then go to the Folders link and add a folder under that server. Now you are set to add your first real study (be sure to delete the samples once you are familiar with how the component works)."
JBS_INS_16_STATEMENT5="3. Click on Studies. Just put in some text to add a new study. Then go to the Media Files tab and enter a media file associated with that study."
